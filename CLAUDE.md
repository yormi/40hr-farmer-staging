# 40hr Farmer / Orisha

Landing page, HubSpot funnel, and email automation for the 40hr Farmer coaching program.

## Read before you write copy, design, or pitch anything

These are the shared brand foundations. Always consult them before producing copy, imagery choices, or funnel changes.

Brand foundations live in the `brand/` submodule. Public site: https://brand.orisha.io/. If the submodule is missing, run `git submodule update --init`.

- [`brand/docs/brand/purpose.md`](brand/docs/brand/purpose.md) — Orisha mission, the Playbook, and the strategic path.
- [`brand/docs/brand/positioning.md`](brand/docs/brand/positioning.md) — Pressure-relief-through-yield thesis and why greenhouse tomatoes are the lever.
- [`brand/docs/brand/products.md`](brand/docs/brand/products.md) — Program pricing, GFM partnership, Helper and Chief Grower details.
- [`brand/docs/brand/ideal-farmer.md`](brand/docs/brand/ideal-farmer.md) — Who the program is for and who it is not for.
- [`brand/docs/brand/voice-and-values.md`](brand/docs/brand/voice-and-values.md) — Voice, style rules, positioning, scarcity, testimonials, red lines.
- [`brand/docs/brand/email-sequences.md`](brand/docs/brand/email-sequences.md) — How we structure multi-email funnels (5-email arc, mechanics, what we do not do).
- [`brand/docs/brand/visual-design.md`](brand/docs/brand/visual-design.md) — Quiet farm journal aesthetic.
- [`brand/docs/internal/story-and-origin.md`](brand/docs/internal/story-and-origin.md) — Canonical 2024/2025 timeline, Drew, Gordon, consulting facts. Not published.
- [`brand/docs/internal/drew-raw-notes.md`](brand/docs/internal/drew-raw-notes.md) — Drew's raw 2025 season field notes (archival source). Not published.
- [`brand/docs/internal/gordon-raw-notes.md`](brand/docs/internal/gordon-raw-notes.md) — Gordon's raw 2025 weekly check-ins from Ten Mothers Farm (archival source). Not published.

## Non-negotiables (inline, because they are easy to forget)

- **The farmer is the hero.** Orisha is the guide. Copy is about the farmer's life, not our product.
- **NO DASHES** in copy output. Use commas, periods, colons, or rewrite.
- **No claims, no promises** on the course. Orisha product guarantees possible but ask Guillaume first.
- **Never** manipulative, flashy, guilt-tripping, preachy, or salesy.
- **Off-limits:** politics, religion, competitor bashing, fear-mongering.
- **Always surface copy drafts for Guillaume's approval** before shipping.

## Project state

See [`docs/project-state.md`](docs/project-state.md) for current phases, key IDs (HubSpot portal, form, workflow, email IDs), and file map.

## Plans + drafts go in `<project>/in-progress/`

Any new plan or draft for a project belongs in that project's own `in-progress/` directory, not in repo-root `docs/`. Examples:

- Welcome-sequence migration plan → `email/welcome-sequence/in-progress/`
- SPEAR copy drafts → `email/spear/in-progress/`
- Landing-page rework drafts → `landing/in-progress/`

When a plan or draft finishes, move the locked content to its canonical home (template file, locked-copy section of `outline.md`, etc.) and delete the in-progress version. `docs/` is reserved for stable repo-wide references (project state, UTM scheme, etc.) — not a graveyard for finished plans.

## Email infrastructure

- **Broadcasts / marketing sends:** **Postmark** (locked 2026-05-25 after eval test send to `guillaume@orisha.io`). Server token in `.secrets/postmark.env`. Default broadcast stream id `broadcast`. Footer unsubscribe token = `{{{ pm:unsubscribe }}}` ([`email/compliance-footer.html`](email/compliance-footer.html)).
- **Welcome sequence:** templates in [`email/welcome-sequence/`](email/welcome-sequence/). Currently sent via HubSpot workflow. Migration off HubSpot onto Postmark not yet scheduled.
- **CRM:** HubSpot only. **Landing page no longer posts to HubSpot** (changed 2026-09-22 when the program went free): the join card posts the email to an Airtable intake webhook and redirects to the Circle community. HubSpot still holds the contact base and runs the welcome sequence. Postmark → HubSpot unsubscribe sync runs hourly via [`.github/workflows/sync-unsubscribes.yml`](.github/workflows/sync-unsubscribes.yml) — scaffold; needs Postmark suppression-list wiring in `scripts/sync-esp-unsubscribes-to-hubspot.py` + `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN` repo secret.
- **API keys:** `.secrets/*.env` files locally (`hubspot.env`); env vars in CI. Scripts follow this pattern.
- Loops, Sequenzy, and Resend were tried and dropped (Loops + Sequenzy 2026-05-15, Resend 2026-05-22). Postmark locked 2026-05-25. Don't reopen ESP-shopping.

## Funnel conversions to optimize

1. Program signup (form submit on landing page).
2. Email open (across the 5-email welcome sequence).
3. Sales call booked with Orisha (Helper or Chief Grower).

## Local dev server

Hot-reload preview for `landing/index.html`:

```bash
./scripts/dev-server.sh
```

Serves `landing/` on `http://localhost:8888` with `/assets` and `/drew-season` mounted from their sibling directories — same path layout as deployed GH Pages. File-watching auto-refresh. Stop with `pkill -f live-server`. Requires Node 22 (managed via `fnm`); the script switches automatically.

**Localhost caveat:** HubSpot Forms Submissions API silently strips field values when the Origin is `localhost`, so contacts created from local-dev submits land with only `email` populated. The form **works fine from the GitHub Pages URLs** (production and staging). Use the staging URL below for full end-to-end browser submit testing.

## Staging preview

Sister repo `yormi/40hr-farmer-staging` deploys to `https://yormi.github.io/40hr-farmer-staging/` via GitHub Pages.

Push the current branch to staging with:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-staging.sh
```

(Force-pushes current HEAD to the staging repo's `main`. Deploys in 30-90s.) Use this to preview any landing-page change in a real GitHub Pages environment before pushing to the production repo.

## Repo layout
